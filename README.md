# MotionCut Intern To-Do List App

Welcome to the MotionCut Intern To-Do List App project! This project is designed to help Python Developer Interns at Motion Cut create a feature-rich To-Do List application using Python and PyQt5.

## Project Overview

The MotionCut Intern To-Do List App is a Python-based application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. It provides a user-friendly interface to add tasks, mark them as completed, update task details, and remove tasks from the list. Additionally, it displays the list of tasks in a table format, making it easy to manage and track tasks efficiently.
